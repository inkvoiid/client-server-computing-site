            <h3>What is Client-Server Computing</h3>
            <p>
              According to Motiso (2022), "A client-server model is a networking
              computing system design that illustrates a relationship between
              two or more computers, where the client computers request and
              receive services or resources from a powerful centralized server
              computer" (Motiso, 2022, para 3)
            </p>
            <p>See Figure 1 for a visual example of Client-Server Computing.</p>
            <p>
              Client-Server Computing distributes tasks between the client and a
              server. The client sends a request for information and the server
              returns a response. This allows many clients to connect to a
              central server and send requests for information, which the server
              can then respond to.
            </p>
            <p>
              A very common example of Client-Server Computing is the Internet.
              When you visit a website, your browser is the client and the
              server is the web server the website is hosted on. When you
              request a page, the web server responds with the page data, which
              can then be displayed by your web browser.

          <h3>Uses of Client-Server Computing</h3>
          <p>
            Client-Server Computing has many uses, such as Web Servers, Email
            Servers and File Servers. This is because they allow the data to be
            stored on the server, which can be accessed by many clients. This
            means that the server can handle a large number of clients, and the
            clients can access the data without having to store it locally. This
            is also why Client-Server Computing is used in the Internet, as it
            allows many clients to request the same data from a centralised
            server.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Why has Client-Server Computing evolved</h3>
          <p>
            There are many reasons Client-Server Computing has evolved, a few of
            them are:
          </p>

          <h4>Increase in Network Speeds</h4>
          <p>
            The increase in network speeds has allowed for faster request and
            response times between the client and server. This has allowed for
            more complex websites/web apps to be developed, and for more clients
            to be connected to the server.
          </p>

          <h4>Scalability</h4>
          <p>
            The fact that the Client-Server model only has to scale on the
            server side to handle the capacity of users means it can be easily
            adapted to handle more users. This is because the server can be
            scaled up by adding more servers to the network, which can then
            handle more clients.
          </p>

          <h4>Advances in Computer Resources</h4>
          <p>
            As computers have become increasingly complex and interconnected,
            the Client-Server model has become widely adopted. Clients aren't
            just "dumb terminals" anymore and can process a fair amount of data.
            There are different styles of Client-Server Computing, such as Thick
            and Thin Client Computing.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>
            Advantages and Disadvantages of different client-server
            architectures
          </h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Thick Client Computing</h4>
          <p>
            Thick Client Computing is a style of Client-Server Computing in
            which the client does most of the processing and data storage
            client-side. This makes the computing feel responsive and have
            better capability with a limited network connection. However, it
            isn't recommended for mobile or remote clients, as they aren't as
            powerful.
          </p>
          <h4>Thin Client Computing</h4>
          <p>
            Thin Client Computing is another style of Client-Server Computing
            that relies mainly on the server to process data and store it. This
            is because the client is usually a mobile device, which doesn't have
            the processing power to do this. This means that the client can be
            used anywhere, and the server can be scaled up to handle more
            clients.

        <h2>Single Pages Applications (SPAs)</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What is a SPA</h3>
          <p>
            A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that only uses
            a single HTML page to display content. When a user navigates to a
            different page on the app, the page isn't reloaded, instead,
            javascript is used to update the HTML page and injects the new
            content into the page. Since the entire page isn't reloaded on
            navigation, the app feels more responsive. Parts of the site that
            are consistent across pages, such as the navigation bar, can be
            injected into the base HTML page, so it doesn't have to be copied
            and pasted into every page, which makes it easier to update. An
            example of a SPA is Gmail, which only uses a single HTML page to
            display content.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>History and Philosophy of SPAs</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>History of the SPA</h4>
          <p>
            The origins of the SPA are unknown, but an early concept of one was
            Stuart Morris' "Self-Contained Website" called slashdotslash in 2002
            (Shvartzman, 2014). Technology similar to the modern SPA was also
            described later in 2002 in a US patent entitled "Delivery of data
            and formatting information to allow client-side manipulation" by
            Lucas Birdeau, Clifford Yeh, Michael Peachey and Kevin Hakman (Ćwik,
            2021).
          </p>
          <h4>Philosophy of SPAs</h4>
          <p>
            Single Page Applications are centered around the idea of a
            simplistic, responsive and interactive user experience.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How they work</h3>
          <p>
            SPAs use a base HTML page to load the structure of the app and then
            injects components into the parts of the page using javascript. This is
            done by using a router to determine which component injects where.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How they differ from traditional web development</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional web development usually consists of designing a site
            page by page, which can have you copy and pasting elements like the
            navigation bar into every page, so when you go to modify it, you
            have to change every instance of it. Whereas with SPA development,
            you can create a navigation bar in a component and then reference it
            where you need it, so when you need to modify it, you only have to
            update the component.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Technologies SPAs make use of</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>HTML, CSS and Javascript/Typescript</h4>
          <p>
            HTML, CSS and Javascript are the building blocks with which the vast
            majority of websites are built. SPAs are no different, and use
            these technologies to create the structure, visual design and
            functionality of the app.
          </p>
          <h4>REST APIs</h4>
          <p>
            REST APIs are used to communicate with the server and retrieve data.
            This is done by sending HTTP requests to the server, which then
            responds with the data in the form of a JSON object. This data is
            then used to update the HTML page.
          </p>
          <h4>Server-Side Frameworks</h4>
          <p>
            Server-side frameworks are used to create the server that the SPA
            communicates with. This is done by creating a server that can handle
            HTTP requests and respond with the data in the form of a JSON
            object. Frameworks can benefits SPAs by potentially improving
            performance and security
          </p>
          <h4>URLs</h4>
          <p>
            Erwin states that underlying technologies that SPAs use like URLs
            are often artificially injected by the browser's History API; this
            seems like a hybrid state instead of a long-term solution. The
            concept of URLs makes sense for document-based websites but needs
            to be rethought from the perspective of SPAs. If not taken care of,
            simple features like the forward and back buttons can break the app,
            resulting in a bad user experience (Erwin, 2021).

        <h2>REST APIs</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What is a REST API</h3>
          <p>
            A Representational State Transfer API (REST API) is an application
            programming interface (API) that allows data to be transmitted over
            a standardised protocol interface like HTML (for web applications)
            or SMTP (for email uses) for example, while conforming to the REST
            architectural principals. REST APIs are used to perform the four
            basic CRUD operations: create, read, update and delete.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Characteristics of a REST API</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Resource-Based</h4>
          <p>
            REST APIs are resource-based, so the URLs used are based on the
            resource rather than the action taken. This means the URL is the
            same for all the different actions that can be taken on the
            resource. For example, the URL for a data entry is the same for when
            you are creating, viewing, editing or deleting the page. This makes
            the URLs easier to understand and remember.
          </p>

          <h4>Stateless</h4>
          <p>
            REST APIs are stateless, which means that each request contains all
            the information needed to complete the request. This means that the
            server doesn't store any information about the client, which means
            every request is independent of the previous request (Red Hat,
            2020).
          </p>

          <h4>Cacheable</h4>
          <p>
            REST APIs are cacheable (Red Hat, 2020), which means that the server
            can cache a response to a request, so that if the same request is
            made, it can just return the already cached response, allowing
            the server to use its resources more efficiently, responding to
            other requests.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How REST can be used in SPA Development</h3>
          <p>
            REST APIs can be used in SPA development to provide the data for the
            SPA. The SPA can then use the data to display the content to the
            user. REST APIs can also be used to perform CRUD operations on
            the data.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Where REST can be used in SPA Development</h3>
          <p>
            REST APIs can be used to retrieve data from a database and display
            it to the user. They can also be used to handle the user's
            authentication and include their access token in the API requests.
            REST APIs can also be used to perform CRUD operations on the data
            received from the database.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Considerations when using a REST API as a SPA solution</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Authentication</h4>
          <p>
            If you decide to use a REST API as a SPA solution, you will need to
            consider how you will handle authentication. If your REST API
            contains sensitive data, you will need to consider how to
            authenticate users to ensure that only authorised users can access
            the data.
          </p>
          <h4>Authorisation</h4>
          <p>
            Another consideration to make is how you will authorise people
            to constrain their access to CRUD operations. For example, if you are
            to use a REST API as a SPA solution for a blog, you will need to
            consider how you will authorise people to create, read, update and
            delete blog posts.
          </p>
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>
            Your REST API will need to be secure, so that it can't be tampered
            with, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS attacks are
            when a malicious script is injected into an otherwise safe website,
            which can be used to steal data or perform other malicious actions
            such as stealing session cookies (Veracode, n.d.).
          </p>
          <h4>Versioning</h4>
          <p>
            When using a REST API for your SPA, you might want to make an update
            to your API, however, if the changes break the older version, people
            who use your API will need to update their code, which can be a lot
            of work. To avoid this, you can use versioning, which allows you to
            make changes to your API without breaking the older version. This
            means that people who use your API can continue to use the older
            version until they are ready to update their code to use the newer
            version.
