# Client-Server Computing Site
This is a site I created to demonstrate my knowledge of Client-Server Computing, Single Page Applications and RESTful APIs for an assignment in my Client-Server Web Development class.

This repo is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://inkvoiid.github.io/client-server-computing-site).
